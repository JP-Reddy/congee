# Concurrent ART (adaptive radix tree) 
[![con-art-rust](https://github.com/XiangpengHao/con-art-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/XiangpengHao/con-art-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A Rust implementation of ART-OLC [concurrent adaptive radix tree](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/artsync.pdf).
It implements the optimistic lock coupling with proper SIMD support.

The code is based on its [C++ implementation](https://github.com/flode/ARTSynchronized), with many bug fixes.

The code is extensively tested with [{address|leak} sanitizer](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/unstable-book/compiler-flags/sanitizer.html) as well as [libfuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).

TODO:

- ~~Streamline the scan operation to improve space locality.~~
- Refactor with more ergonomic Rust implementation
- Implement delete
- Align the API with the `std::collections::BTreeMap`'s.
